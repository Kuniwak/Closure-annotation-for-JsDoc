h1. Closure annotation for JsDoc

h2. Abstract

This is a JsDoc plugin that makes better JsDoc annotations from Closure annotations.

For example:
your script:

<pre>
goog.provide('foo');


/** @const */
foo.CONST = 'foobar'; // This constant will NOT be listed.
</pre>

So, this plugin add namespace annotation then it finds using goog.provide in your script:

<pre>
/**
 * @namespace
 * @name foo
 */


/** @const */
foo.CONST = 'foobar'; // This constant will be listed.
</pre>

And the plugin will NOT add namespace annotation if the argument looks like a constructer name.
